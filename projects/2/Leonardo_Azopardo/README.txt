How to run the program:
1) Make sure the file Point2DWithIndex is in the same folder 
as the other files.
2) Compile with "javac", run with "java"

Special Conditions:
I created a subclass Point2DWithIndex, so I could find the point with the smallest 
index and output the convex hull in the right order.

Errors:
Two different Slow Convex Hull files are included, SlowConvexHull2 outputs the hull in the right
order for a few cases, and is extremely ugly and inefficient, and SlowConvexHull finds the points
that form the convex hull for almost every case, but not in the right order, it is a lot more efficient and better written.
